let’s build out a Terraform VPC + Subnet module that you can drop straight 
into your project repo. This will give you a solid starting point for 
AWS networking, which is the backbone of your cost‑optimized IaC project.

--> Structure for:
modules/
└── vpc/
    ├── main.tf
    ├── variables.tf
    └── outputs.tf


let’s extend the VPC module with a NAT Gateway setup 
so that instances in the private subnet can reach the internet 
(for updates, pulling Docker images, etc.) without being directly exposed. 
This is a real-world DevOps pattern you’ll use for Jenkins agents, 
app servers, or Kubernetes worker nodes.

How to Use in  ├── environments/dev/main.tf

✅ This gives you a production-ready VPC with public + private subnets, 
cost‑tracking tags, and internet access for the public subnet. 
From here, you can plug in your compute module (EC2/EKS) and 
security module (IAM, Secrets Manager).

modules/
└── vpc/
    ├── main(updated with NAT Gateway).tf
    ├── variables.tf
    └── outputs(updated with NAT Gateway).tf

-->How This Works
#Public Subnet → Has Internet Gateway (IGW) for inbound/outbound traffic.

#Private Subnet → Routes outbound traffic through NAT Gateway in the public subnet.

#Result → Private instances can download packages, connect to APIs, 
or pull Docker images, but remain inaccessible from the internet.
