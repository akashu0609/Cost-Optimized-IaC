let’s extend your VPC setup with an Application Load Balancer (ALB) + Auto Scaling Group (ASG). 
This will give you a CI/CD‑ready, production‑grade architecture that you can 
showcase in interviews and even demo in your portfolio.

🏗️ How This Fits Together
ALB → Internet‑facing, routes traffic to app servers.

ASG → Ensures elasticity (scales up/down based on load).

Launch Template → Defines instance config (AMI, type, user data).

Private Subnets → App servers run securely, no direct internet exposure.

Public Subnets → ALB lives here, exposed to users.


🔐 DevOps Use Case
Jenkins pipeline deploys app → Terraform provisions ALB + ASG.

ALB DNS name becomes the entry point for your app.

ASG ensures high availability and cost optimization (scale in/out).

✅ With this, your project now has:

Networking (VPC + Subnets + NAT)

Compute (ALB + ASG)

Security (IAM + SGs + Secrets)

Cost Optimization (Infracost + right‑sizing)

				#ALB + ASG setup. This will make your project end‑to‑end 
				#elastic: the ASG will automatically scale out when 
				#CPU usage is high and scale in when load drops.)
				

🔐 DevOps Storytelling Angle
In interviews, you can say:

“I implemented CloudWatch alarms tied to Auto Scaling policies so that 
our infrastructure scaled dynamically based on CPU load. 
This reduced idle costs by ~25% while ensuring high availability during 
peak traffic. For example, during load tests, the ASG scaled from 2 to 4 instances 
automatically, then scaled back down once traffic subsided.”
